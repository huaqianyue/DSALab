# `tsgdbmi` - Get structured output from GDB/MI

This is a subproject of [Dev-C++ 7](https://github.com/Guyutongxue/devcpp7) and [clavicode](https://github.com/Guyutongxue/clavicode-backend). **I do not intend to make it a public library.** So use at your own risk.

No documentation now. But you can have a look at `test/test.mjs` as an example.

```
npm i @gytx/tsgdbmi
```

This repo is mainly "translated" from [pygdbmi](https://github.com/cs01/pygdbmi). I just adjust (or simplify) its IO manage.
